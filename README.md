Python for Newbies
==================

This is a guide to Python for *absolute beginners*. It contains everything you need to know for the [IPython minibook](http://ipython-books.github.io/minibook/), by [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net). Although this book focuses on Python for data analysis, we won't cover data analysis in this guide, only general programming and Python topics.

This is a work in progress. Feel free to contribute!
